# How to play

Survive as long as you can as you face wave after wave (pun intended) of enemies.  Pick up your fishy friends to charge your FISH FRENZY BAR.  Once full, embrace your full shark power!

Enemies can drop health and power-ups to help you out!

# Controls

Gamepad is best.  Left stick moves, right stick aims.  Right trigger enables FISH FRENZY! (Or X button on the web version due to controller challenges)

Mouse and keys: WASD (or AZERTY equivalent) with the mouse to aim and fire.  Hit E to enable FISH FRENZY
